# Smart Produce Recogniton System

## Project Overview
This project aims at developing a computer vision-based object classifier placed in view of the checkout register. It will identify produce items—such as red onion, yellow onion, Fiji apple, eggplant, etc.—with a quantifiable level of confidence, reducing the time customers spend searching for items at checkout and thereby streamlining the process.
