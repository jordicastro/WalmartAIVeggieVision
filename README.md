# Smart Produce Recogniton System

## Project Overview
This project aims at developing a computer vision-based object classifier placed in view of the checkout register. It will identify produce items—such as red bell pepper, orange bell pepper, Fiji apple, jalapenos, etc.—with a quantifiable level of confidence, reducing the time customers spend searching for items at checkout and thereby streamlining the process.
